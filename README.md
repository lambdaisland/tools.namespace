lambdaisland.tools.namespace
========================================

This is a friendly fork of
[clojure.tools.namespace](https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace), created
for use in [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha).

I strongly discourage you from using this fork yourself. It is not "better" than
the original, but contains patches very particular to the needs of Kaocha. It
also prevents problems due to version mismatch between the version of
tools.namespace that Kaocha relies on, and the version used in other projects or
tools.
